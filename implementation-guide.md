# COIL Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide defines the requirements for creating a conformant implementation of the COIL specification. It clarifies what features and behaviors must be supported to ensure compatibility between different COIL tools and runtimes.

## Conformance Levels

COIL implementations may conform at different levels:

### Level 1: Core Conformance

A Level 1 implementation provides the minimum functionality required to process COIL programs:

1. **Universal ISA (ISA-U) Support**: 
   - Must implement all instructions in the Universal ISA (0x00-0x9F)
   - Must support all required type behaviors for these instructions

2. **Type System Support**:
   - Must support all fixed-width integral types (INT8, UNT8, INT16, etc.)
   - Must support all fixed-width floating-point types (FP32, FP64)
   - Must support basic vector types (V128)

3. **Memory Model**:
   - Must implement at least the Flat memory model
   - Must support the basic variable system

4. **Binary Format**:
   - Must correctly parse and generate COIL binary format as specified
   - Must support the standard instruction encoding

### Level 2: Extended Conformance

A Level 2 implementation adds support for extended features:

1. **Extended ISA (ISA-E) Support**:
   - Must implement all CPU operations relevant to the supported architectures
   - Must implement architecture-specific operations for at least one architecture

2. **Extended Type System**:
   - Must support all complex types (CINT, CUNT, CVEC, MAT, etc.)
   - Must support all composite types (STRUCT, PACK, UNION)

3. **Enhanced Memory Model**:
   - Must implement the Protected memory model
   - Must support all addressing modes

4. **Compiler Directives**:
   - Must support all conditional compilation directives
   - Must support all code organization directives

### Level 3: Complete Conformance

A Level 3 implementation provides comprehensive support for all COIL features:

1. **Complete ISA Support**:
   - Must implement all Universal, Extended, and Compiler instructions
   - Must support multiple processing unit types if applicable

2. **Full Type System**:
   - Must support all specialized types
   - Must implement all type extension flags

3. **Advanced Memory Models**:
   - Must implement all memory models (Flat, Protected, Segmented)
   - Must support multi-threading and synchronization

4. **Heterogeneous Computing**:
   - Must support code generation for multiple processing units
   - Must implement CBC generation and execution

## Implementation Requirements

### Instruction Behavior

1. **Type-Determined Behavior**:
   - Instructions must adapt their behavior based on operand types
   - The same instruction with different operand types must produce the specified behavior

2. **Instruction Encoding**:
   - Must follow the binary format specification exactly
   - Must encode and decode all instruction forms correctly

3. **Flags and Results**:
   - Must set condition flags as specified for each instruction
   - Must produce results within the specified precision requirements

### Error Handling

All COIL implementations must handle errors consistently:

1. **Compilation Errors**:
   - Invalid instruction encoding must be detected and reported
   - Type mismatches must be reported with clear error messages
   - Unsupported features must be identified specifically

2. **Runtime Errors**:
   - Division by zero must generate appropriate exceptions or signals
   - Out-of-bounds memory access must be detected in Protected memory model
   - Stack overflow/underflow must be detected and reported

3. **Error Reporting**:
   - Error messages must identify the specific instruction causing the error
   - Errors must include location information (file, offset, etc.) when available
   - Implementation-defined behavior must be clearly documented

### ABI Compatibility

1. **Standard ABIs**:
   - Must correctly implement specified ABIs (SystemV, Microsoft, etc.)
   - Must handle parameter passing according to ABI specifications
   - Must respect stack frame requirements

2. **Calling Conventions**:
   - Must support the defined calling conventions
   - Must correctly manage caller/callee saved registers
   - Must handle return values as specified

## Testing and Validation

A conformant implementation should be validated through:

1. **Instruction Tests**:
   - Each instruction must be tested with various operand types
   - Edge cases and special values must be tested
   - Flag setting behavior must be verified

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Complete programs must execute with expected results
   - Memory management must be verified across program execution
   - Performance characteristics should be within expected ranges

3. **Conformance Test Suite**:
   - The official COIL conformance test suite (when available) must be passed
   - Implementation-specific extensions must not break standard behavior

## Implementation Recommendations

While not required for conformance, these practices are highly recommended:

1. **Optimization**:
   - Utilize target-specific optimizations where possible
   - Respect optimization directives in the code
   - Provide performance tuning options

2. **Debugging Support**:
   - Maintain debug information throughout compilation
   - Provide mechanisms for step-by-step execution
   - Support variable inspection

3. **Tool Integration**:
   - Provide clear APIs for integration with other tools
   - Support standard file formats for interoperability
   - Document all implementation-specific behaviors

## Version Compatibility

1. **Forward Compatibility**:
   - Implementations should ignore unknown opcodes or features
   - Unknown types should be preserved when possible
   - Version information should be checked and respected

2. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - New versions should support code written for older versions
   - Deprecated features should generate warnings but still function
   - Major version changes may break compatibility as documented

## Implementation-Defined Behavior

Some aspects of COIL are intentionally implementation-defined. These must be clearly documented, including:

1. **Performance Characteristics**:
   - Instruction timing and throughput
   - Memory access patterns and caching behavior
   - Optimization strategies

2. **Resource Limitations**:
   - Maximum program size
   - Maximum variable count
   - Stack size limits

3. **Extension Mechanisms**:
   - Vendor-specific instructions
   - Custom type implementations
   - Platform-specific optimizations

By following these guidelines, implementers can create COIL systems that maintain compatibility while taking advantage of platform-specific capabilities.
