# COIL Byte Code (CBC)

## Overview

COIL Byte Code (CBC) is a compact, portable binary representation designed for debugging, runtime code generation, and heterogeneous computing support. It is not intended as the primary compilation target for COIL but serves specialized purposes within the COIL ecosystem.

## Purpose

CBC addresses several specific needs in the COIL ecosystem:

1. **Debugging Support**: Enable inspection and manipulation of code at runtime
2. **JIT Compilation**: Facilitate runtime code generation for dynamic environments
3. **Heterogeneous Computing**: Support execution on multiple device types
4. **Runtime Device Selection**: Allow deferring device targeting decisions until runtime
5. **Standard Library Integration**: Enable the standard library to interact with multiple processing units

## Design Principles

CBC follows these design principles:

1. **Specialization**: Optimized for its specific purposes, not as a universal format
2. **Pre-Optimization**: Generated by the COIL processor after analysis and optimization
3. **Device Targeting**: Each CBC file targets a specific processing unit or architecture
4. **Debugging Focus**: Contains metadata to support debugging workflows
5. **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and JIT compilation, not for direct interpretation

## Generation Process

CBC is generated through this workflow:

```
Source -> Compiler -> COIL -> [Source.o && Source.cbc]
```

Where:
- Source.o: Native object binary with code for the host system
- Source.cbc: Byte code for device code or debugging purposes

The COIL processor creates both outputs as needed.

## Relationship to COIL

CBC is derived from COIL but differs in several key ways:

| Aspect       | COIL                          | CBC                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Purpose      | Universal intermediate language| Specialized execution format  |
| Primary Use  | Compilation to native code    | Debugging and JIT compilation |
| Optimization | Platform-independent analysis | Device-specific pre-optimization |
| Encoding     | Type-rich, explicit           | Compact, implicit             |
| Structure    | Object-oriented               | Stack-oriented                |
| Scope        | Complete program              | Execution units               |

## Use Cases

### Debugging

CBC facilitates debugging by:
1. Maintaining symbolic information
2. Preserving type information
3. Supporting single-stepping and breakpoints
4. Enabling runtime code inspection

### JIT Compilation

For JIT scenarios, CBC provides:
1. Pre-optimized instruction sequences
2. Type information for runtime specialization
3. Dependency information for linking
4. Efficient encoding for fast parsing

### Heterogeneous Computing

For multi-device scenarios, CBC enables:
1. Device-specific code representation
2. Runtime device selection
3. Device-appropriate optimizations
4. Consistent execution across diverse environments

## Standard Library Integration

The standard library uses CBC to:
1. Invoke the COIL JIT Compiler (`coil::jit::Compiler`)
2. Load device-specific code at runtime
3. Execute code on appropriate processing units
4. Manage heterogeneous execution environments

## Format Specification

CBC uses a specialized binary format:

```
[CBC Header]
[Metadata Section]
[Symbol Table]
[Type Table]
[Instruction Stream]
[Debug Information] (optional)
```

The CBC header identifies:
1. Target processing unit
2. Target architecture
3. Required capabilities
4. Optimization level
5. Debugging information presence

## Implementation Requirements

CBC implementations must:
1. Support efficient parsing for JIT compilation
2. Maintain all necessary debugging information when required
3. Precisely encode all COIL semantics
4. Support device-specific optimizations
5. Integrate with the standard library JIT mechanisms

## Relationship with CASM

While CBC is a binary format, CASM can be used to:
1. Visualize CBC content
2. Debug CBC execution
3. Generate CBC for testing purposes

However, CASM is not required to use CBC.
