# CBC Execution Environment

## Memory Model

CBC uses a simplified memory model with five distinct regions:

1. **Code Memory**: Read-only section containing instructions
2. **Constant Memory**: Read-only section containing constants
3. **Stack Memory**: Automatic memory for local variables and operands
4. **Heap Memory**: Dynamic memory allocation
5. **Variable Storage**: Abstract storage for variables (similar to COIL)

This model balances efficiency with flexibility for diverse execution environments.

## Variable System

CBC maintains COIL's variable system with numeric IDs:

```
var #1, i32                   ; Declare variable #1 as 32-bit integer
add.i32 #1, #1, const(5)      ; Add constant 5 to variable #1
```

The CBC processor manages the mapping between variable IDs and physical storage. This abstraction enables efficient register allocation in JIT environments while maintaining compatibility with COIL's programming model.

## Execution Models

CBC supports three primary execution models:

### 1. Pure Interpretation

The interpreter directly executes CBC instructions without compilation:
- Decodes each instruction and performs the corresponding operation
- Maintains a variable table mapping IDs to storage locations
- Suitable for environments where JIT is unavailable or startup time is critical

### 2. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation

The JIT compiler translates hot code paths to native code:
- Initially interprets all code
- Monitors execution frequency to identify hot paths
- Compiles frequently executed code to native instructions
- Maintains compatibility with the interpreted portions
- Balances startup time with runtime performance

### 3. Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation

For environments that support it, CBC can be pre-compiled:
- Translates all CBC to native code before execution
- Eliminates interpretation overhead
- Maintains the CBC format for portability
- Suitable for performance-critical applications with predictable behavior

## CBC Processor Components

A CBC processor must implement these components:

1. **Decoder**: Parse CBC instructions and operands
2. **Interpreter**: Execute instructions directly
3. **Variable Manager**: Track variables and their lifetimes
4. **Memory Manager**: Manage memory access and allocation
5. **JIT Compiler**: (Optional) Compile hot code paths to native code

## Integration with COIL Ecosystem

CBC fits into the COIL ecosystem in the following ways:

1. **Compilation Path**: 
   ```
   CASM → COIL → [COIL Processor] → CBC → CBC Interpreter
   ```

2. **Section Integration**:
   CBC code can be stored in dedicated sections within .coilo files, allowing:
   - Mixed native/interpreted execution
   - Dynamic loading of interpreted components
   - Platform-independent portions of otherwise native applications

3. **Language Backends**:
   - Dynamic languages can target CBC directly
   - Enables implementation of higher-level language runtimes on the COIL foundation

## Error Handling

CBC defines standardized error codes categorized by operation type:

1. **Decoder Errors**: Invalid instruction format or encoding
2. **Type Errors**: Invalid types for operations
3. **Memory Errors**: Access violations or alignment issues
4. **Resource Errors**: Stack overflow or resource exhaustion
5. **Arithmetic Errors**: Division by zero, overflow, etc.

Error handling modes:
- **Trap**: Terminate execution immediately
- **Exception**: Throw catchable exception
- **Status**: Return error status from function

## Optimization Techniques

CBC processors typically employ these optimization techniques:

1. **Direct Threading**: Using computed goto or function pointers for faster dispatch
2. **Superinstructions**: Combining common instruction sequences
3. **Inline Caching**: Caching type information for polymorphic operations
4. **Register Allocation**: Mapping hot variables to registers
5. **Escape Analysis**: Determining which allocations can be stack-allocated

## Security Considerations

CBC execution environments must address:

1. **Memory Safety**: Enforcing proper bounds checking and preventing unauthorized access
2. **Type Safety**: Preventing type confusion vulnerabilities
3. **Stack Protection**: Guarding against stack overflow attacks
4. **Resource Limits**: Preventing resource exhaustion attacks

Proper implementation of these protections is essential for secure CBC execution.
