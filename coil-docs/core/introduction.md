# Introduction to COIL

## Overview

The Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL) is a universal binary instruction format designed to enable portable, high-performance code across diverse computing architectures. COIL bridges the gap between high-level programming languages and hardware-specific machine code.

## Purpose

COIL addresses several key challenges in modern computing:

1. **Hardware Diversity**: Computing devices span CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and specialized accelerators
2. **Portability vs. Performance**: Traditional approaches sacrifice one for the other
3. **Complexity of Optimization**: Manually optimizing for each platform is labor-intensive
4. **Binary Compatibility**: Ensuring code works across different architectures

## Core Design Philosophy

COIL is built on these foundational concepts:

### Type-Determined Instructions

Instructions derive their behavior from operand types, allowing a single opcode to handle different data types:

```
ADD result, a, b  ; Works for integers, floats, or vectors based on operand types
```

This approach provides:
- A compact instruction set
- Consistent behavior patterns across types
- Natural extensibility as new types are added

### Architecture Independence

COIL maintains a clean separation between:

- **Universal Operations** (0x00-0xBF): Guaranteed to work identically across all platforms
- **Architecture-Specific Operations** (0xC0-0xFE): Tailored to specific devices
- **Extension Operations** (0xFF): For vendor-specific features

### Variable System

COIL's variable system abstracts away register allocation and memory management:

```
VAR #1, TYPE_INT32, 0  ; Declare variable
ADD #1, #1, 42         ; Use variable
```

The COIL processor automatically:
- Assigns optimal storage (registers or memory)
- Manages variable lifetimes
- Handles register spilling when needed

### ABI System

The Application Binary Interface (ABI) system automates function calls across architectures:

```
; Platform-independent function call
CALL add_numbers, TYPE_ABICTL=ABICTL_PARAM=platform_default, a, b
```

This eliminates the need to manually implement different calling conventions.

## COIL in the Toolchain

COIL serves as an intermediate representation in a complete toolchain:

```
Source Code → Frontend Compiler → COIL → COIL Processor → Native Code → Execution
```

The COIL ecosystem includes:
- **CASM**: Text representation of COIL for direct programming
- **COIL Assembler**: Converts CASM to COIL binary format
- **COIL Processor**: Translates COIL to architecture-specific code
- **CBC**: Bytecode format for interpretation and JIT compilation

## Current Status

COIL v1.0 provides:
- Complete CPU-oriented instruction set
- Comprehensive type system
- Binary formats (.coil and .coilo)
- ABI mechanisms for function calling
- Variable and scope systems
- Basic toolchain support
