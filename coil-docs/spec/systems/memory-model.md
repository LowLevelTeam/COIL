# COIL Memory Model

## Purpose

This document defines the memory model for COIL, establishing the rules for memory organization, access patterns, memory ordering, and memory management. A well-defined memory model is essential for consistent behavior across different implementations and processor types.

## Key Concepts

- **Address Space**: How memory is organized and addressed
- **Memory Sections**: How code and data are organized
- **Access Rules**: Alignment requirements and access sizes
- **Memory Ordering**: Rules for operation ordering and visibility
- **Scope-Based Management**: How memory is managed through scopes

## Memory Organization

### Address Space

COIL defines a linear address space with the following characteristics:
- Byte-addressable memory
- Platform-dependent size (typically matching the pointer width)
- Zero-based addressing
- No reserved regions in the core model

Processing unit-specific implementations may have:
- Reserved address ranges
- Segmented memory access methods
- Memory-mapped resources

### Memory Sections

COIL programs organize memory into sections, each with specific attributes:
- **Code Sections**: Contain executable instructions
- **Data Sections**: Contain initialized program data
- **Uninitialized Data (BSS)**: Zero-initialized data
- **Stack Section**: Manages function calls and local variables
- **Heap Section**: Dynamically allocated memory (if supported)

Section attributes control:
- **Executable**: Instructions can be fetched from this section
- **Readable**: Data can be read from this section
- **Writable**: Data can be written to this section
- **Shared**: Section can be shared between multiple contexts

```
SECTION .text, 0x01 | 0x04    ; Executable and readable
SECTION .data, 0x02 | 0x04 | 0x08  ; Writable, readable, initialized
SECTION .bss, 0x02 | 0x04 | 0x10   ; Writable, readable, uninitialized
```

## Memory Access Rules

### Alignment Requirements

COIL defines alignment requirements for memory access:

1. **Natural Alignment**: By default, accesses should use natural alignment for the data type:
   - 1-byte types: 1-byte alignment
   - 2-byte types: 2-byte alignment
   - 4-byte types: 4-byte alignment
   - 8-byte types: 8-byte alignment
   - 16-byte types: 16-byte alignment
   - Vector types: Size-dependent alignment (typically 16, 32, or 64 bytes)

2. **Alignment Control**:
   - The `ALIGN` directive forces alignment of subsequent data
   - Type extensions can specify alignment requirements
   - Memory operations can specify alignment attributes

3. **Unaligned Access**:
   - Explicitly marked with `MEMORY_CTRL_UNALIGNED`
   - May be emulated on processor types that don't support it natively
   - May incur performance penalties

### Endianness

COIL supports both little-endian and big-endian memory access:

1. **Default Endianness**:
   - Inherited from the target processor
   - Specified in the configuration

2. **Explicit Endianness Control**:
   - For binary I/O operations
   - For cross-processor compatibility
   - Using `BSWAP` and related instructions

### Memory Access Sizes

Memory operations work with specific sizes:

1. **Typed Access**:
   - Access size determined by the operand type
   - Ranges from 1 byte to processor limits

2. **Block Operations**:
   - `MEMCPY`, `MEMSET`, `MEMCMP` for block operations
   - Size specified explicitly

## Memory Ordering Model

### Sequential Consistency

By default, COIL follows a sequentially consistent memory model:
- Operations appear to execute in program order
- All processors observe the same global ordering of operations
- Visibility of changes is immediate to all processors

### Relaxed Memory Ordering

For performance optimization, COIL supports relaxed memory models:

1. **Memory Barriers**:
   - Full barriers: Enforce ordering of all memory operations
   - Store barriers: Enforce ordering of store operations
   - Load barriers: Enforce ordering of load operations

2. **Ordering Attributes**:
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_ACQUIRE`: Acquire semantics for loads
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_RELEASE`: Release semantics for stores
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_RELAXED`: No ordering guarantees
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_SEQ_CST`: Sequential consistency

3. **Fence Instruction**:
   ```
   FENCE type  ; Where type specifies barrier type
   ```

### Atomic Operations

COIL provides atomic operations for thread synchronization:

1. **Atomic Instructions**:
   - `CAS` (Compare and Swap)
   - `XCHG` (Exchange)
   - Atomic arithmetic operations

2. **Atomicity Guarantees**:
   - All-or-nothing execution
   - No partial updates visible
   - Ordering based on specified memory ordering

Example:
```
; Atomic compare and swap
CAS [lock_address], 0, 1, TYPE_PARAM0=MEMORY_CTRL_ATOMIC
```

## Scope-Based Memory Management

COIL provides scope-based memory management:

1. **Scope Creation**:
   - `SCOPEE` instruction creates a new variable scope
   - Nested scopes are supported

2. **Scope Destruction**:
   - `SCOPEL` instruction destroys current scope
   - Automatically releases all variables in the scope

3. **Scope Implementation**:
   - May use stack frames
   - May optimize by reusing storage

### Stack Management

Stack operations follow these rules:

1. **Stack Growth**:
   - Direction determined by processor
   - Automatic for function calls
   - Explicit with `PUSH`/`POP`

2. **Stack Alignment**:
   - Follows ABI requirements
   - May be processor-specific

3. **Stack Limits**:
   - Implementation-defined maximum size
   - Optional overflow checking

### Dynamic Memory (Optional)

COIL v1 optionally supports dynamic memory:

1. **Allocation**:
   - Implementation-defined mechanism
   - Not part of core instruction set

2. **Deallocation**:
   - Explicit release required
   - No automatic garbage collection

## Memory Access Examples

### Direct Memory Access
```
; Access memory at fixed address
MOV [0x1000], 42

; Access memory at address in register
MOV [TYPE_RGP=RAX], 42

; Access memory with offset
MOV [base_ptr + 8], value
```

### Indexed Access
```
; Array element access: base + index*scale
MOV element, [array + index*4]

; Structure field access
MOV field, [struct_ptr + offset]
```

### Memory Block Operations
```
; Fill a block with a value
MEMSET buffer, 0, 1024       ; Zero out 1KiB of memory

; Copy a block
MEMCPY dest, src, size

; Compare memory blocks
MEMCMP result, block1, block2, size
```

## Memory Safety

### Bounds Checking

COIL defines rules for bounds checking:

1. **Static Bounds Checking**:
   - Performed at compile-time where possible
   - Enforced for constant indices

2. **Dynamic Bounds Checking**:
   - Optional runtime checking
   - Configuration-controlled
   - Implementation-defined handling of violations

### Type Safety

Memory access respects type safety rules:

1. **Type Compatibility**:
   - Access must use compatible types
   - Type punning requires explicit `CAST` instructions

2. **Pointer Arithmetic**:
   - Properly scaled by pointed-to type size
   - Bounds-checked when enabled
