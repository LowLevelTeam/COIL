# Vector Operations

## Overview

Vector operations provide specialized instructions for working with vector types, arrays, matrices, and tensors. These operations enable efficient manipulation of multiple data elements, supporting both element-wise operations and higher-level mathematical computations.

Note: Basic arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, etc.) are already supported for vectors through the standard arithmetic instructions with type inference. This section covers only specialized vector operations that would not make sense for scalar values.
