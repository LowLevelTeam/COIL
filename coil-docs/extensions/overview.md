# COIL Extensions Framework

## Overview

The COIL Extensions Framework provides a standardized mechanism for extending COIL functionality beyond the core specification. Extensions enable specialized capabilities without complicating the base language, allowing COIL to adapt to diverse processing environments while maintaining portability.

## Extension Categories

COIL extensions are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Core Extensions

Extensions that enhance the fundamental capabilities of COIL:

- **Multi-Dimensional Types**: Vectors, matrices, and tensors with associated operations
- **Composite Types**: Structures, unions, and complex data types
- **Preprocessor**: Conditional compilation, definitions, and compile-time evaluation

### 2. Processing Unit Extensions

Extensions specific to particular processing units:

- **CPU Extensions**: Traditional CPU-specific instructions and features
- **GPU Extensions**: Graphics and parallel processing capabilities
- **NPU Extensions**: Neural network accelerator instructions
- **DSP Extensions**: Digital signal processing optimizations

### 3. Architecture Extensions

Extensions targeting specific hardware architectures:

- **x86/x64**: Intel/AMD CPU architecture extensions
- **ARM**: ARM CPU architecture extensions
- **RISC-V**: RISC-V CPU architecture extensions

### 4. Functional Extensions

Extensions that add domain-specific functionality:

- **Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms and operations
- **Compression**: Data compression/decompression algorithms
- **Graphics**: Advanced graphics processing operations
- **Networking**: Network protocol operations

## Extension Identification

Each extension is uniquely identified by:

1. **Extension ID**: A unique numeric identifier
2. **Extension Name**: A human-readable name (e.g., "MultiDim")
3. **Extension Version**: Major.minor.patch version number

## Integration Mechanism

Extensions are integrated into COIL through several mechanisms:

### Instruction Space Allocation

- **Extended Operations (0xA0-0xDF)**: Reserved for processing unit and architecture extensions
- **Compiler Operations (0xF0-0xFE)**: Used by preprocessor and other compile-time extensions
- **Vendor-Specific (0xFF)**: Used with extended opcode for vendor extensions

### Type System Integration

- **Type Extensions (Type Opcode Ranges)**: Specific type opcode ranges reserved for extensions
- **Type Modifiers**: Additional type modifiers defined by extensions

### Binary Format Extensions

- **Extension Headers**: Additional headers in the object format
- **Extension Sections**: Specialized sections in object files

## Compatibility Rules

Extensions follow strict compatibility rules:

1. **Fallback Behavior**: Code using extensions must gracefully degrade if extension not available
2. **Explicit Declaration**: Extensions must be explicitly declared in the object file
3. **Version Checking**: Runtime checking for extension compatibility
4. **Core Independence**: Core COIL functionality must work without extensions

## Standard Extensions

### Multi-Dimensional Types Extension

Provides support for vectors, matrices, and tensors:

- **Type Opcodes**: 0x33-0x38 (CVEC, MAT, SQMAT, etc.)
- **Instruction Opcodes**: 0x82-0x8E (DOT, CROSS, NORM, etc.)
- **Features**:
  - Vector operations (dot product, cross product, normalization)
  - Matrix operations (transpose, inverse, determinant)
  - Tensor operations (contraction, product, etc.)

### Composite Types Extension

Extends the type system with complex data structures:

- **Type Opcodes**: 0xA0-0xA3 (STRUCT, PACK, UNION, ALIAS)
- **Features**:
  - Structure definitions with named fields
  - Packed structures for memory optimization
  - Unions for memory-overlapping fields
  - Type aliases for code clarity

### ABI Extension

Defines standardized Application Binary Interfaces:

- **Features**:
  - Calling conventions (parameter passing, return values)
  - Register allocation rules
  - Stack frame layout
  - Exception handling mechanisms

### Preprocessor Extension

Provides compile-time code manipulation:

- **Instruction Opcodes**: 0xF0-0xF9
- **Features**:
  - Conditional compilation
  - Macro definitions and expansion
  - Compile-time constants
  - Include directives

## Extension Development

To develop a new COIL extension:

1. **Specification Creation**:
   - Define extension purpose and functionality
   - Allocate opcodes from appropriate ranges
   - Define binary format additions
   - Document compatibility requirements

2. **Implementation**:
   - Create reference implementation
   - Develop test suite for validation
   - Ensure graceful degradation when not available

3. **Registration**:
   - Register extension with the COIL community
   - Assign official extension ID
   - Document in the extensions registry

## Extension Registry

The COIL Extension Registry maintains the official list of extensions:

| ID   | Name     | Version | Category | Description |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 0x01 | MultiDim | 1.0.0   | Core     | Multi-dimensional types and operations |
| 0x02 | Composite| 1.0.0   | Core     | Composite data types |
| 0x03 | ABI      | 1.0.0   | Core     | Application Binary Interface definitions |
| 0x04 | Preproc  | 1.0.0   | Core     | Preprocessor functionality |
| 0x10 | CPU.x86  | 1.0.0   | PU       | x86/x64 CPU extensions |
| 0x11 | CPU.ARM  | 1.0.0   | PU       | ARM CPU extensions |
| 0x12 | CPU.RISCV| 1.0.0   | PU       | RISC-V CPU extensions |
| 0x20 | GPU.Core | 1.0.0   | PU       | Core GPU functionality |
| 0x30 | Crypto   | 1.0.0   | Function | Cryptographic operations |
| 0x31 | Compress | 1.0.0   | Function | Compression algorithms |

## Implementation Requirements

A compliant COIL implementation must:

1. **Core Support**: Fully implement the core COIL specification
2. **Extension Detection**: Provide a mechanism to detect available extensions
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing extensions appropriately
4. **Extension Versioning**: Check extension version compatibility
5. **Documentation**: Clearly document supported extensions
