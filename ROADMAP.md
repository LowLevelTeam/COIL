# COIL Specification Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the planned development trajectory for the COIL specification, implementation, and ecosystem. It serves as a guide for contributors and implementers to understand current priorities and future directions.

## Current Status

The COIL specification is currently in development with the following progress:

- **Core Specification**: ~80% complete
  - Type system, memory model, and instruction set largely defined
  - Binary format and linking model established
  - Object format detailed
  
- **Extensions**: ~40% complete
  - Multi-dimensional types framework established
  - Composite types framework defined
  - ABI and preprocessor extensions partially specified
  
- **Processing Units**: ~30% complete
  - CPU instruction set partially defined
  - GPU, NPU, and DSP instruction sets in early planning
  
- **Tools**: ~20% complete
  - Basic concepts defined
  - Detailed syntax and semantics in progress
