# Contributing to COIL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the COIL (Computer Oriented Intermediate Language) specification. This document outlines the process for contributing to the documentation and evolution of the COIL standard.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the following principles:
- Respect the technical and philosophical goals of the COIL project
- Engage in constructive, professional communication
- Focus on technical merit and specification clarity

## Contribution Process

### For Documentation Improvements

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the COIL specification repository.
2. **Make Changes**: Update or add documentation in your fork.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Include a clear description of your changes and their purpose.

### For Specification Changes

1. **Discussion First**: Major changes to the COIL specification should begin with an issue outlining the proposed change and its rationale.
2. **Proof of Concept**: When applicable, provide examples or proof-of-concept implementations demonstrating the value of your proposal.
3. **Specification Update**: After discussion and approval in principle, submit a formal specification update.
4. **Review Process**: All specification changes require review by multiple members of the Low Level Team.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Document all behaviors explicitly
- Provide examples for complex concepts
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout
- Follow the established directory structure

## Versioning

- Minor clarifications use patch version updates (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)
- Non-breaking additions use minor version updates (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)
- Breaking changes require major version updates (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)

## Areas for Contribution

Current priority areas for contribution include:
- ISA documentation completion
- Implementation guides
