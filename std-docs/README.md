# COIL Standard Library

## Overview

The COIL Standard Library provides operating system abstractions, utility functions, and cross-platform services that supplement the core COIL specification. It serves as the bridge between COIL's direct device interaction model and operating system services when required.

## Purpose and Philosophy

The standard library adheres to these principles:

1. **Core/Library Separation**: Clear separation between core COIL (OS-independent) and library (OS-interfacing)
2. **Device Abstraction**: Provide consistent interfaces for device interactions across platforms
3. **Heterogeneous Computing Support**: Enable code execution across multiple processing units
4. **Minimal Overhead**: Minimize performance impact of OS abstractions
5. **Optional Usage**: Programs can choose not to use the standard library for bare-metal environments

## Library Components

### Core Components

1. **System Interface**
   - Operating system call wrappers
   - Process and thread management
   - File system operations
   - Environment variables

2. **Memory Management**
   - Dynamic memory allocation
   - Memory pools and arenas
   - Garbage collection (optional)

3. **I/O Operations**
   - File I/O
   - Network I/O
   - Console I/O
   - Formatted I/O

4. **Data Structures**
   - Containers (lists, maps, sets)
   - Strings
   - Smart pointers
   - Iterators

### Specialized Components

1. **Heterogeneous Computing**
   - COIL JIT Compiler interface
   - CBC loading and execution
   - Device selection and management
   - Workload distribution

2. **Concurrency**
   - Mutex, semaphore, condition variables
   - Thread pools
   - Task-based parallelism
   - Atomic operations wrappers

3. **Debugging Support**
   - Logging
   - Assertions
   - Tracing
   - Profiling

## Heterogeneous Computing Model

The standard library enables heterogeneous computing through:

1. **Runtime Device Selection**
   - Detect available processing units
   - Select optimal device based on workload
   - Fall back gracefully when preferred device unavailable

2. **COIL Byte Code (CBC) Support**
   - Load and JIT-compile CBC for specific devices
   - Manage CBC lifecycle
   - Provide debugging tools for CBC execution

3. **Device Communication**
   - Transfer data between processing units
   - Synchronize operations
   - Map memory between different address spaces

## Usage Patterns

### Basic OS Interaction

```
// Standard library usage for OS interaction
file = std::io::open("example.txt", READ);
data = std::io::read(file, 1024);
std::io::close(file);
```

### Heterogeneous Computing

```
// Utilize multiple processing units
device = std::compute::select_device(COMPUTE_CAPABILITY);
program = std::compute::load_cbc("kernel.cbc");
result = std::compute::execute(device, program, args...);
```

## Implementation

The standard library is implemented with:

1. A thin OS-specific layer for each supported platform
2. A common interface layer that abstracts OS differences
3. Pure COIL implementations of algorithms and data structures
4. Bridge code for CBC execution on various processing units

## Platform Support

Initial platform support includes:

1. **Operating Systems**
   - Linux
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Bare-metal (no OS)

2. **Processing Units**
   - CPU (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
   - GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
   - NPU (when available)

## Usage Notes

1. **Explicit Import**: Standard library components must be explicitly imported
2. **No Global State**: Components avoid global state to enable fine-grained usage
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error reporting mechanism
4. **Resource Management**: RAII-style resource handling where appropriate
