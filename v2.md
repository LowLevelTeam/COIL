# COIL v2 Specification: Standard Library
WARNING: This is not an actualy COIL specification but an idea for future development. COIL v2 will be the COIL standard library but how it looks it not decided.


## 1. Introduction

COIL version 2 extends the COIL v1 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) by defining a comprehensive standard library. This specification does not modify the core ISA, but rather establishes a standardized set of functions, data structures, and interfaces that all COIL processors must implement.

## 2. Relationship to COIL v1

COIL v2 maintains full compatibility with the v1 ISA specification:
- All v1 instructions, types, and features remain unchanged
- The v1 binary format is preserved
- v1 programs will execute correctly in a v2 environment

The v2 standard library is implemented using the primitives defined in v1, allowing for efficient, architecture-specific implementations while maintaining a consistent interface.

## 3. Standard Library Organization

The COIL standard library is organized into functional modules:

### 3.1 Core Functions
- Memory management
- String manipulation
- Basic data structures
- Error handling
- Debug facilities

### 3.2 Mathematics
- Basic arithmetic extensions
- Trigonometric functions
- Statistical functions
- Linear algebra primitives
- Random number generation

### 3.3 Input/Output
- File operations
- Stream abstractions
- Formatted output
- Parsing utilities
- Binary data handling

### 3.4 System Interface
- Time and date functions
- System information
- Process control
- Resource management
- Environment access

### 3.5 Algorithm
- Sorting and searching
- Hash functions
- Compression/decompression
- Encryption/decryption primitives
- Pattern matching

## 4. Implementation Requirements

The standard library functions must be available through a consistent interface regardless of the underlying architecture. Each function is defined by:

### 4.1 Function Signature
```
function_name(parameter_types) -> return_types
```

### 4.2 ABI Requirements
Standard library functions follow a consistent ABI:
- Parameters passed according to target architecture's conventions
- Return values structured for efficient access
- Error reporting through standardized mechanisms

### 4.3 Performance Guarantees
- Big-O complexity guarantees for algorithms
- Space complexity limitations
- Atomicity and thread-safety guarantees where applicable

## 5. Standard Library Interface

### 5.1 Symbol Naming Convention

Standard library functions use a consistent naming convention:
```
std.[module].[function]
```

For example:
- `std.core.malloc` - Memory allocation
- `std.math.sin` - Sine function
- `std.io.fopen` - File open

### 5.2 Calling Convention

Standard library functions are called using the normal CALL instruction:

```
CALL std.core.malloc, size
```

The COIL processor resolves the standard library symbols at link time or runtime.

## 6. Core Data Structures

### 6.1 Standard Containers
- Array (fixed and dynamic)
- List (singly and doubly linked)
- Map (hash-based and tree-based)
- Set
- Stack and Queue

### 6.2 Memory Management
- Allocators interface
- Reference counting
- Region-based allocation
- Pool allocators

### 6.3 String Types
- Immutable strings
- Mutable string buffers
- Unicode support
- Pattern matching

## 7. I/O Operations

### 7.1 File System Operations
- File opening, closing, reading, writing
- Directory manipulation
- Path handling
- Metadata access

### 7.2 Stream Operations
- Input streams
- Output streams
- Bidirectional streams
- Buffering mechanisms

### 7.3 Formatted I/O
- Parsing from text
- Formatting to text
- Binary data serialization/deserialization

## 8. Mathematics Library

### 8.1 Basic Functions
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
- Exponential and logarithmic functions
- Power and root functions
- Absolute value, floor, ceiling

### 8.2 Advanced Mathematics
- Linear algebra operations (matrices, vectors)
- Fourier transforms
- Statistical functions
- Interpolation and approximation

## 9. Standard Library Extension Mechanism

### 9.1 Vendor Extensions
Vendors may extend the standard library using the namespace:
```
vendor.[vendor_name].[module].[function]
```

### 9.2 Domain-Specific Extensions
Domain-specific extensions use the namespace:
```
ext.[domain].[module].[function]
```

## 10. Versioning

### 10.1 Standard Library Versioning
The standard library has its own version number:
```
std.version.major
std.version.minor
std.version.patch
```

### 10.2 Module Versioning
Individual modules may evolve at different rates:
```
std.[module].version
```

### 10.3 Compatibility Requirements
- Functions must maintain backward compatibility
- Deprecated functions must be marked and supported for at least one major version
- New functions must not conflict with existing functions

## 11. Implementation Notes

### 11.1 Optimized Implementations
COIL processors are encouraged to provide optimized implementations for each architecture:
- Use of specialized hardware instructions
- Vectorization where applicable
- Memory layout optimizations

### 11.2 Fallback Implementations
For functions without direct hardware support, standard implementations are provided:
- Pure COIL v1 implementations
- Progressive performance degradation
- Consistent behavior guarantees

## 12. Testing and Conformance

### 12.1 Standard Test Suite
A standard test suite verifies:
- Functional correctness
- Performance within expected bounds
- Error handling behavior
- Compatibility across architectures

### 12.2 Conformance Levels
- Level 1: Core functionality only
- Level 2: Full standard library
- Level 3: Extended functionality
