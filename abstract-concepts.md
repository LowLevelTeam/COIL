# Abstract Concepts That Need Clarification

Several areas of the COIL specification remain too abstract and require additional concrete details to be fully implementable:

## 1. Implementation-Specific Behaviors

### Current Issues
- Many error handling scenarios don't specify concrete error codes or behaviors
- Runtime memory management details are underspecified
- The exact behavior of the COIL processor for edge cases is often left undefined

### Needed Improvements
- Specify exact error codes for every possible error condition
- Define precise behavior for all edge cases (division by zero, overflow, etc.)
- Specify minimum requirements for memory management
- Define conformance testing procedures

## 2. ABI Implementation Details

### Current Issues
- While the ABI system is described conceptually, exact register mappings for common platforms are underspecified
- Parameter passing for complex types (large structs, unions) lacks concrete details
- Variadic function handling is not clearly specified

### Needed Improvements
- Provide complete register allocation tables for common platforms (x86-64, ARM64)
- Define exact algorithms for parameter passing of all data types
- Specify calling convention handling for variadic functions

## 3. Optimization Requirements

### Current Issues
- The optimization responsibilities of COIL processors are unclear
- There's no specification for what optimizations are required vs. optional
- Performance expectations are not quantified

### Needed Improvements
- Define a minimum set of required optimizations
- Specify optimization levels (similar to -O0, -O1, etc.)
- Provide benchmarking methodologies to validate implementations

## 4. Standardized Library Interface

### Current Issues
- System interfaces (I/O, threading, etc.) are not standardized
- The boundary between the language and operating system is unclear
- Standard library features for v2 are only roughly outlined

### Needed Improvements
- Define a concrete standard library API for basic operations
- Specify how COIL programs interface with operating system resources
- Create a more detailed standard library specification

## 5. Validation and Verification

### Current Issues
- No formal validation suite is specified
- Implementation compliance testing procedures are undefined
- Security and safety validation is not addressed

### Needed Improvements
- Define a standard validation suite for implementations
- Specify security requirements and testing
- Create a formal compliance testing procedure

## 6. Debugging Protocol

### Current Issues
- While debug information format is specified, the runtime debugging protocol is not
- Interaction between debuggers and COIL processors is undefined
- Step execution, breakpoints, and watch variables lack specific protocols

### Needed Improvements
- Define a standard debugging protocol
- Specify breakpoint implementation requirements
- Define debugger-to-processor communication

## 7. Binary Compatibility Guarantees

### Current Issues
- While versioning is mentioned, exact binary compatibility guarantees aren't clear
- Forward and backward compatibility requirements need clearer specification
- Version compatibility testing procedures aren't defined

### Needed Improvements
- Specify exact compatibility requirements between versions
- Define version negotiation protocols
- Create compatibility testing procedures
