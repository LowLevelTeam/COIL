# COIL Memory Model

## Purpose

This document defines the memory model for COIL, establishing the rules for memory organization, access patterns, memory ordering, and memory management. A well-defined memory model is essential for consistent behavior across different implementations and processor types.

## Memory Organization

### Address Space

COIL defines a linear address space with the following characteristics:
- Byte-addressable memory
- Platform-dependent size (typically matching the pointer width)
- Zero-based addressing
- No reserved regions in the core model

Processing unit-specific implementations may have:
- Reserved address ranges
- Segmented memory access methods
- Memory-mapped resources

### Memory Sections

COIL programs organize memory into sections, each with specific attributes:

| Section Type | Purpose | Common Attributes |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Code Section | Executable instructions | Executable, Readable |
| Data Section | Initialized program data | Readable, Writable |
| BSS Section | Zero-initialized data | Readable, Writable, Uninitialized |
| Stack Section | Function calls and local variables | Readable, Writable |
| Heap Section | Dynamically allocated memory | Readable, Writable |

Section attributes are defined as bit flags:
- `0x01`: Executable - Instructions can be fetched from this section
- `0x02`: Writable - Data can be written to this section
- `0x04`: Readable - Data can be read from this section
- `0x08`: Initialized - Section contains initialized data
- `0x10`: Uninitialized - Section contains uninitialized (zero-filled) data

Example section definition:
```
SECTION .text, 0x01 | 0x04    ; Executable and readable
SECTION .data, 0x02 | 0x04 | 0x08  ; Writable, readable, initialized
SECTION .bss, 0x02 | 0x04 | 0x10   ; Writable, readable, uninitialized
```

## Scope-Based Memory Management

COIL provides automatic memory management through scopes:

### Scope Creation and Destruction

Scopes are created and destroyed using explicit instructions:

```
SCOPEE       ; Enter a new scope
  ; Variables and code in this scope
SCOPEL       ; Leave the scope (and destroy all variables declared within it)
```

### How Scopes Manage Memory

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Variables and resources are allocated when they are declared in a scope
   - Scope tracks all resources created within it

2. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - When a scope is exited (using SCOPEL), all variables in that scope are automatically released
   - Register and memory resources are reclaimed
   - No manual deallocation is required

3. **Nested Scopes**:
   - Scopes can be nested to create hierarchies of resource lifetimes
   - Inner scopes can access resources from outer scopes
   - When an inner scope is exited, only its own resources are released

Example of nested scopes:
```
SCOPEE       ; Outer scope
  VAR TYPE_INT32, outer_var, 10
  
  SCOPEE     ; Inner scope
    VAR TYPE_INT32, inner_var, 20
    ; Both outer_var and inner_var are accessible here
  SCOPEL     ; inner_var is destroyed here
  
  ; Only outer_var is accessible here
SCOPEL       ; outer_var is destroyed here
```

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Typically implemented as stack-based memory management
   - Memory used for variables is allocated in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) fashion
   - Enables efficient and predictable memory management

## Memory Access Rules

### Alignment Requirements

COIL defines alignment requirements for memory access:

1. **Natural Alignment**: By default, accesses should use natural alignment for the data type:
   - 1-byte types: 1-byte alignment
   - 2-byte types: 2-byte alignment
   - 4-byte types: 4-byte alignment
   - 8-byte types: 8-byte alignment
   - 16-byte types: 16-byte alignment
   - Vector types: Size-dependent alignment (typically 16, 32, or 64 bytes)

2. **Explicit Alignment Control**:
   - The `ALIGN` directive forces alignment of subsequent data
   - Memory operations can specify alignment attributes

### Memory Access Modes

COIL supports different memory access modes:

1. **Direct Access**:
   ```
   ; Access memory at fixed address
   MOV [0x1000], 42
   
   ; Access memory through pointer
   MOV [ptr], value
   ```

2. **Indexed Access**:
   ```
   ; Base + offset
   MOV [base_ptr + 8], value
   
   ; Base + scaled index
   MOV [array_ptr + index*4], value
   ```

3. **Block Operations**:
   ```
   ; Copy memory blocks
   MEMCPY dest_ptr, src_ptr, size
   
   ; Fill memory
   MEMSET buffer, 0, size
   ```

## Memory Ordering Model

### Sequential Consistency

By default, COIL follows a sequentially consistent memory model:
- Operations appear to execute in program order
- All processors observe the same global ordering of operations
- Visibility of changes is immediate to all processors

### Relaxed Memory Ordering

For performance optimization, COIL supports relaxed memory models:

1. **Memory Barriers**:
   - Full barriers: Enforce ordering of all memory operations
   - Store barriers: Enforce ordering of store operations
   - Load barriers: Enforce ordering of load operations

2. **Ordering Attributes**:
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_ACQUIRE`: Acquire semantics for loads
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_RELEASE`: Release semantics for stores
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_RELAXED`: No ordering guarantees
   - `MEMORY_CTRL_SEQ_CST`: Sequential consistency

### Atomic Operations

COIL provides atomic operations for thread synchronization:

1. **Compare and Swap**:
   ```
   ; Atomic compare and swap
   CAS [lock_address], expected, new, TYPE_PARAM0=MEMORY_CTRL_ATOMIC
   ```

2. **Exchange**:
   ```
   ; Atomic exchange
   XCHG [shared_var], new_value, TYPE_PARAM0=MEMORY_CTRL_ATOMIC
   ```

## Memory Safety

### Bounds Checking

COIL provides mechanisms for memory safety:

1. **Static Bounds Checking**:
   - The COIL processor may perform compile-time checking where possible
   - Constant index bounds can be validated at compile time

2. **Dynamic Bounds Checking**:
   - Optional runtime bounds checking for array and pointer access
   - Configuration-controlled to balance safety and performance

### Type Safety in Memory

Memory access should respect type safety:

1. **Type Compatibility**:
   - Memory access should use compatible types
   - Type punning requires explicit CAST operations

2. **Pointer Safety**:
   - Pointer arithmetic is scaled by the pointed-to type size
   - Optional null pointer checks

## Integration with Other Systems

### Variable System Integration

The memory model integrates with the variable system:

1. **Variable Storage**:
   - Variables are allocated in memory when they can't fit in registers
   - Variables follow scope-based lifetime management

2. **Variable Promotion/Demotion**:
   - Variables can be promoted to registers or demoted to memory
   - The processor optimizes based on usage patterns

### ABI System Integration

The memory model integrates with the ABI system:

1. **Stack Management**:
   - The stack follows ABI-specific alignment requirements
   - Function parameters and locals use ABI-defined layout

2. **Memory Parameter Passing**:
   - Large parameters may be passed in memory
   - Memory layout follows ABI specifications
