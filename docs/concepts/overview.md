# COIL Design Philosophy

## Purpose

This document explains the foundational design principles that guide COIL (Computer Oriented Intermediate Language), providing context for the technical decisions in the specification.

## What is COIL?

COIL is a universal binary instruction format designed for maximum portability across diverse processing architectures while enabling native performance. It serves as an intermediate representation between high-level programming languages and hardware-specific machine code.

## Core Design Principles

### Type-Determined Instruction Philosophy

COIL's most distinctive characteristic is its type-determined instruction approach. Rather than having separate opcodes for each variant of an operation, COIL instructions derive their behavior from the types of their operands.

**Key benefits:**
- Compact instruction set with fewer opcodes
- Consistent behavior across different data types
- Extensibility without opcode explosion
- Simplified instruction decoding

For example, a single `ADD` instruction works across integers, floating-point values, and vectors, with behavior determined by operand types.

### Binary Format Primacy

COIL is fundamentally a binary instruction format. The text representation (COIL-ASM) is a human-readable interface to this binary format, but the binary encoding is the authoritative definition.

This approach ensures:
- Clear specification boundaries
- Simplified tool implementation
- Direct mapping between text and binary forms

### Architecture Independence

COIL maintains a clean separation between universal operations and architecture-specific features:

- Universal operations work identically across architectures
- Architecture-specific operations are cleanly isolated
- The variable system abstracts over registers
- The ABI system abstracts over calling conventions

This separation enables maximum portability while still allowing direct access to hardware-specific features when needed.

### Performance-First Approach

While providing abstractions, COIL never sacrifices performance:

- Direct mapping to hardware capabilities where possible
- No abstraction penalties for universal operations
- Variable promotion/demotion for register optimization
- Explicit control over performance-critical aspects

### Abstraction Without Penalty

COIL provides powerful abstractions that don't compromise performance:

- Variable system instead of direct register manipulation
- ABI system for function calls and parameter passing
- Scope-based memory management
- Type-safe memory operations

## Version Evolution Strategy

COIL evolves through distinct versions with clear boundaries:

- **Version 1** (Current): Core CPU-focused instruction set, variable system, and ABI mechanism
- **Version 2** (Planned): Standard library and enhanced features
- **Version 3** (Future): Multi-device operations across heterogeneous processing units

## Design Inspiration

COIL draws inspiration from:
- LLVM IR's type system
- Traditional assembly languages' direct hardware access
- High-level languages' variable and scope concepts
- Virtual machines' portability
- GPU programming models' data parallelism
