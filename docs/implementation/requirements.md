3. **Support All Opcodes**: Implement all universal instructions (0x00-0x2F, 0x50-0xBF)
4. **Handle Types**: Support all defined types and correctly implement type-based instruction behavior
5. **Object Format**: Process COIL object files according to the format specification

### Type System Implementation

A compliant COIL processor must implement the COIL type system:

1. **All Types**: Support all required type categories and extensions
2. **Type Operations**: Implement all type operations correctly
3. **Type Compatibility**: Enforce type compatibility rules
4. **Type Conversions**: Support explicit conversions between compatible types
5. **Type Safety**: Maintain type safety during all operations

### Variable System Implementation

A compliant COIL processor must implement the variable system:

1. **Variable Declaration**: Support variable declaration and initialization
2. **Variable Allocation**: Intelligently allocate variables to registers or memory
3. **Variable Scoping**: Implement scope-based variable lifetimes
4. **Variable Promotion/Demotion**: Support variable promotion to registers and demotion to memory
5. **Variable Memory Management**: Automatically manage memory for variables

### ABI System Implementation

A compliant COIL processor must implement the ABI system:

1. **Standard ABIs**: Support all defined standard ABIs
2. **Custom ABIs**: Allow for custom ABI definitions
3. **Parameter Passing**: Implement ABI-based parameter passing
4. **Return Values**: Support ABI-based return value handling
5. **Register Preservation**: Correctly preserve registers according to ABI rules

### Memory Model Implementation

A compliant COIL processor must implement the memory model:

1. **Address Spaces**: Support the defined memory address space
2. **Memory Operations**: Implement all memory operations correctly
3. **Memory Alignment**: Respect alignment requirements
4. **Memory Ordering**: Support the defined memory ordering model
5. **Memory Safety**: Implement appropriate memory safety checks

## Platform-Specific Requirements

### CPU Implementation Requirements

For CPU implementations (PROC 0x01), a compliant COIL processor must:

1. **Target Architecture**: Support at least one CPU architecture defined in the specification
2. **Architecture Modes**: Support all modes of the implemented architecture
3. **Register Mapping**: Map COIL variables to appropriate registers
4. **Instruction Translation**: Efficiently translate COIL instructions to native CPU instructions
5. **CPU-Specific Features**: Implement required CPU-specific instructions (0xC0-0xFE) for the supported architecture

## Performance Requirements

A compliant COIL processor should achieve:

1. **Comparable Performance**: Performance comparable to equivalent native code
2. **Reasonable Memory Usage**: Efficient memory usage without excessive overhead
3. **Deterministic Execution**: Consistent execution behavior for identical inputs
4. **Scalability**: Ability to handle both small and large COIL programs

## Error Handling Requirements

A compliant COIL processor must:

1. **Error Detection**: Detect and report all specified error conditions
2. **Error Reporting**: Provide clear, informative error messages
3. **Graceful Failure**: Fail gracefully when errors are encountered
4. **Error Categories**: Support all defined error categories
5. **Recovery**: Continue processing where possible after non-fatal errors

## Validation and Testing

A compliant COIL processor should:

1. **Test Suite**: Pass the COIL test suite (when available)
2. **Self-Validation**: Include self-validation capabilities
3. **Edge Cases**: Correctly handle all specified edge cases
4. **Conformance Testing**: Support conformance testing mechanisms

## Versioning Support

A compliant COIL processor must:

1. **Version Checking**: Verify that COIL file versions are compatible
2. **Feature Detection**: Detect and handle unsupported features
3. **Forward Compatibility**: Process newer minor versions to the extent possible
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Fully support all previous versions within the same major version

## Security Requirements

A compliant COIL processor must:

1. **Validate Input**: Thoroughly validate all input before processing
2. **Memory Safety**: Prevent buffer overflows and other memory violations
3. **Resource Management**: Manage resources safely to prevent leaks
4. **Privilege Separation**: Respect privilege boundaries
5. **Safe Defaults**: Use safe default behaviors

## Documentation Requirements

A compliant COIL processor must provide documentation that:

1. **Describes Implementation**: Details the implementation approach
2. **Documents Limitations**: Clearly states any limitations or deviations from the specification
3. **Provides API**: Describes any provided APIs
4. **Includes Examples**: Provides usage examples

## Conformance Levels

COIL processors may conform at different levels:

1. **Minimal Conformance**: Implements all required features for a single architecture
2. **Standard Conformance**: Implements all required features plus optimization and debug support
3. **Full Conformance**: Implements all features including optional ones

## Implementation Strategy Recommendations

For efficiency and correctness, COIL processors should:

1. **Use Type Dispatch**: Implement instruction behavior based on operand types
2. **Register Allocation**: Use graph coloring or linear scan algorithms for register allocation
3. **Optimize Common Paths**: Focus optimization on common code paths
4. **Incremental Processing**: Process COIL files incrementally where possible
5. **Layered Implementation**: Use a layered implementation approach for maintainability
