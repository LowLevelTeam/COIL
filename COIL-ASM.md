# COIL Assembly: A Text Representation for Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL) is fundamentally a **binary instruction format** designed to be generated by compilers and processed by COIL processors. It is not intended for direct human authoring or reading.

This document introduces "COIL Assembly" (COIL-ASM), a text-based representation of COIL that serves **documentation and debugging purposes only**. COIL-ASM is not part of the core COIL specification but is a supplementary tool to make COIL more accessible for learning, discussion, and debugging.

## 2. Relationship to COIL Binary Format

COIL-ASM is:
- A human-readable representation of COIL binary instructions
- A documentation tool for examples and specifications
- A potential input/output format for debugging tools
- **Not** a replacement for the binary COIL format
- **Not** a required component for COIL processors to implement

## 3. COIL-ASM Syntax

The COIL-ASM syntax used in documentation examples follows these conventions:

```
; Comment starts with semicolon
INSTRUCTION operand1, operand2  ; Each instruction on its own line

; Directives start with a period
.PROC 0x01
.ARCH 0x01, 0x03

; Symbols are defined with the SYM instruction
SYM symbol_name

; Type information is indicated with TYPE_ prefix
MOV TYPE_INT32, 42

; Registers with TYPE_RGP= prefix
ADD TYPE_RGP=RAX, 10
```

## 4. Binary Encoding Example

To illustrate the relationship between COIL-ASM and actual COIL binary encoding:

**COIL-ASM:**
```
MOV TYPE_RGP=RAX, 42
```

**Corresponding Binary Encoding:**
```
0x10                ; Opcode for MOV
0x02                ; Two operands
0x92 0x00           ; TYPE_RGP with register ID for RAX
0x13 0x20           ; TYPE_UNT32 with TYPEEXT_IMM
0x2A 0x00 0x00 0x00 ; Value 42 (little-endian)
```

## 5. Tools for COIL-ASM

While not part of the core COIL specification, the following tools could be developed to work with COIL-ASM:

- **COIL Assembler**: Converts COIL-ASM text to COIL binary format
- **COIL Disassembler**: Converts COIL binary format to COIL-ASM text
- **COIL Debugger**: Uses COIL-ASM for display and interaction with COIL code

## 6. Implementation Note

COIL processor implementations are not required to support COIL-ASM. The core COIL processor requirement is to process the binary COIL format as defined in the specification.

## 7. Documentation Usage

All examples in the COIL documentation that use the COIL-ASM format are for illustration purposes. When implementing a COIL processor, refer to the binary encoding specifications in the core documentation.

## 8. Future Considerations

A formal specification for COIL-ASM may be developed as a separate document from the core COIL specification. This would standardize the text representation for debugging tools and documentation, while maintaining the separation between the binary format (COIL) and its text representation (COIL-ASM).
