# COIL Glossary

## Architecture and Processor Terminology

### Processing Unit
A physical computational device that executes instructions. Examples include CPU, GPU, TPU, etc. In COIL v1, the focus is primarily on CPUs.

### Architecture
The fundamental instruction set and register model of a processing unit, without regard to specific implementation details. Examples include x86, ARM, RISC-V.

### Mode
A specific operating mode of an architecture that significantly changes the available features, register widths, or behavior. For example:
- **x86** architecture has three primary modes:
  - **16-bit mode** (Real mode)
  - **32-bit mode** (Protected mode)
  - **64-bit mode** (Long mode)
- **ARM** architecture has:
  - **32-bit mode** (AArch32)
  - **64-bit mode** (AArch64)
- **RISC-V** architecture has:
  - **32-bit mode** (RV32)
  - **64-bit mode** (RV64)
  - **128-bit mode** (RV128)

### Processor
A specific implementation of an architecture by a manufacturer. Examples include Intel Core i7 (x86), Apple M1 (ARM), etc.

### Microarchitecture
The implementation details of a processor, such as pipeline design, cache structure, and branch prediction. Examples include Intel Skylake, ARM Cortex-A76.

## COIL Specific Terminology

### COIL Processor
A software implementation that processes COIL code. This could be a compiler, interpreter, JIT compiler, or hardware implementation.

### COIL Object (.coil)
A binary format containing COIL instructions, symbols, and metadata.

### COIL Output Object (.coilo)
A processed output format containing architecture-specific binary code and linking information.

### ABI (Application Binary Interface)
A set of conventions for function calls, parameter passing, and register usage.

### Type-Determined Instruction
An instruction whose behavior is determined by the types of its operands, rather than having specific opcodes for each variant.

### Directive
An instruction that controls the compilation process rather than generating runtime code.

## Common Abbreviations

### ISA - Instruction Set Architecture
The complete set of instructions, registers, and behaviors defined by an architecture.

### SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data
A computational approach where a single instruction operates on multiple data points simultaneously.

### JIT - Just-In-Time (Compilation)
A technique where code is compiled during execution rather than in advance.

### AOT - Ahead-Of-Time (Compilation)
A technique where code is compiled completely before execution.

### TDP - Thermal Design Power
The maximum amount of heat generated by a processing unit that the cooling system is designed to dissipate.
