# Reserved Instructions (0x30-0x4F)

## 1. Purpose of Reserved Instructions

The opcode range 0x30-0x4F is intentionally reserved in COIL v1 for future multi-device operations to be introduced in COIL v3. This section documents how COIL v1 implementations should handle these opcodes and provides a preview of the planned functionality.

## 2. Handling Reserved Instructions in v1

### 2.1 Implementation Requirements

COIL v1 processors MUST:

1. Recognize opcodes 0x30-0x4F as reserved instructions
2. Reject any COIL code that contains these opcodes with an appropriate error message
3. Return error code 2008 (Reserved instruction used) when encountering these opcodes
4. Provide clear documentation that these opcodes are reserved for future use

### 2.2 Error Handling

When a reserved instruction is encountered, implementations should:

1. Generate a specific error message:
   ```
   ERROR [E2008]: Use of reserved instruction
   at offset: 0x0000XXXX
   opcode: 0xYY
   description: Opcode 0xYY is reserved for future COIL versions
   ```

2. Halt compilation or execution
3. Not attempt to interpret or execute the instruction

### 2.3 Documentation Requirements

Implementations must document that:
1. Opcodes 0x30-0x4F are reserved for future use
2. These opcodes will be used for multi-device operations in COIL v3
3. No valid COIL v1 program should contain these opcodes

## 3. Future Use in COIL v3

This section provides informational content about the planned use of these opcodes in COIL v3. This information is provided for forward planning purposes only and is not part of the COIL v1 specification.

### 3.1 Multi-Device Operation Categories

In COIL v3, these opcodes will be allocated to the following categories:

#### Device Management (0x30-0x34)
```
0x30 - DEVSEL  - Select target device for subsequent operations
0x31 - DEVINFO - Query device capabilities and status
0x32 - DEVSET  - Configure device parameters
0x33 - DEVLA   - Device load analyzer
0x34 - DEVWAIT - Wait for device operations to complete
```

#### Memory Transfer Operations (0x35-0x3A)
```
0x35 - MEMXFER - Transfer memory between devices
0x36 - MEMPIN  - Pin memory for cross-device access
0x37 - MEMAP   - Map memory across device boundaries
0x38 - MEMUNP  - Unpin cross-device memory
0x39 - MEMUMAP - Unmap cross-device memory
0x3A - MEMSTRM - Establish memory streaming between devices
```

#### Synchronization Primitives (0x3B-0x3F)
```
0x3B - DEVSYNC - Synchronize operations across devices
0x3C - DEVBAR  - Barrier for cross-device operations
0x3D - DEVLOCK - Acquire cross-device lock
0x3E - DEVULCK - Release cross-device lock
0x3F - DEVFENC - Memory fence across devices
```

#### Parallel Execution (0x40-0x44)
```
0x40 - PARBEG  - Begin parallel execution region
0x41 - PAREND  - End parallel execution region
0x42 - PARFOR  - Parallel for loop
0x43 - PARTASK - Create parallel task
0x44 - PARWAIT - Wait for task completion
```

#### Workload Distribution (0x45-0x49)
```
0x45 - WLDIST  - Distribute workload across devices
0x46 - WLBAL   - Workload balancing directive
0x47 - WLPREF  - Workload device preference
0x48 - WLQUER  - Query workload status
0x49 - WLFIN   - Finalize distributed workload
```

#### Queue Management (0x4A-0x4F)
```
0x4A - QCREATE - Create execution queue
0x4B - QSUBMIT - Submit work to queue
0x4C - QWAIT   - Wait for queue completion
0x4D - QFLUSH  - Flush queue
0x4E - QPRI    - Set queue priority
0x4F - QDEST   - Destroy queue
```

### 3.2 Forward Compatibility Considerations

While v1 implementations must reject these opcodes, code planning for v3 can include:

1. **Conditional Compilation**:
   ```
   IF COIL_VERSION >= 3.0
     ; Use multi-device instructions
     DEVSEL 0x02  ; Select GPU
   ELSE
     ; Use v1 compatible approach
     ; ...
   ENDIF
   ```

2. **Feature Detection**:
   Future COIL code may detect feature support:
   ```
   PROC 0x01
   ; Check if multi-device is supported
   ; ...
   ```

3. **Documentation Comments**:
   ```
   ; COIL v3: This will use DEVSEL for device selection
   ; COIL v1: Using software dispatch instead
   ```

## 4. Implementation Guidance

### 4.1 Tool Support

COIL v1 tools should:

1. Provide clear error messages when reserved opcodes are encountered
2. Include validation checks to identify reserved opcodes
3. Document the reserved status in opcode listings
4. Optionally provide warnings about future compatibility

### 4.2 Development Planning

Developers creating COIL implementations should:

1. Design their instruction decoders to easily accommodate the reserved opcodes in future versions
2. Structure code to allow extension for multi-device support
3. Consider how their memory model will extend to multi-device scenarios
4. Plan for validation of the reserved opcodes when implementing v3

## 5. Versioning Implications

The use of reserved opcodes has implications for COIL versioning:

1. No valid v1 COIL object should contain these opcodes
2. A COIL object containing these opcodes must be treated as a v3 (or later) object
3. Version detection logic should check for these opcodes
4. Tool chains should prevent accidental generation of these opcodes in v1 code

## 6. Documentation for Future Reference

This section will be expanded in COIL v3 to include:

1. Complete specification of each instruction
2. Operand requirements and types
3. Memory model implications
4. Platform-specific behaviors
5. Error handling and edge cases
6. Performance considerations
7. Security implications
8. Example usage patterns

## 7. Conclusion

The reserved instruction space 0x30-0x4F is a critical part of COIL's forward compatibility strategy. By clearly defining how v1 implementations should handle these opcodes, we ensure a smooth transition path to multi-device support in future versions while maintaining the integrity of the v1 specification.
