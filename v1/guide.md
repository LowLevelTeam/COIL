# COIL Implementation Guidelines

This document provides guidance for implementing COIL v1 compliant tools and processors. It outlines the requirements, recommended approaches, and verification methods to ensure consistent behavior across implementations.

## 1. Core Components of a COIL Implementation

A complete COIL v1 implementation should include the following components:

### 1.1 COIL Processor

The COIL processor is the core component that processes COIL instructions. It may operate as:
- A compiler (translating COIL to native code)
- An interpreter (executing COIL instructions directly)
- A JIT compiler (compiling at runtime)

A COIL processor must:
1. Parse the complete COIL binary format
2. Understand and apply the full type system
3. Implement all universal instructions (0x00-0x2F, 0x50-0xBF)
4. Handle at least one CPU architecture specifically
5. Process COIL objects and produce COIL output objects
6. Apply configurations as specified

### 1.2 COIL Assembler

A COIL assembler converts text-based COIL-ASM to binary COIL format:
1. Parse the COIL-ASM syntax
2. Resolve symbols where possible
3. Encode instructions in the binary format
4. Output valid COIL objects

### 1.3 COIL Disassembler

A COIL disassembler converts binary COIL to text-based COIL-ASM:
1. Parse the binary COIL format
2. Decode instructions
3. Format in human-readable COIL-ASM syntax

### 1.4 COIL Linker

A COIL linker combines multiple COIL objects:
1. Resolve external symbols
2. Merge sections
3. Handle relocations
4. Produce executable COIL code

## 2. Implementation Approaches

### 2.1 Layered Design

A recommended architecture for COIL implementations follows a layered approach:

1. **Binary Format Layer**
   - Handles parsing and generation of COIL binary format
   - Manages sections, symbols, and metadata

2. **Instruction Decoder/Encoder Layer**
   - Translates between binary representation and instruction structures
   - Validates instruction format and operands

3. **Type System Layer**
   - Manages type information and compatibility
   - Handles type conversions and checks

4. **Execution/Compilation Layer**
   - For interpreters: executes instructions
   - For compilers: translates to target code
   - For JIT: generates native code at runtime

5. **Architecture-Specific Layer**
   - Implements architecture-specific behaviors
   - Maps COIL registers to target registers
   - Handles ABI compliance

### 2.2 Type-Driven Design

Since COIL follows a type-determined instruction philosophy, implementations should:

1. Make type handling central to the architecture
2. Use dynamic dispatch based on operand types
3. Implement type compatibility rules as defined in the specification

### 2.3 Memory Management

Implementations should follow these memory management principles:

1. Clearly separate code, data, and metadata
2. Respect alignment requirements
3. Implement efficient variable allocation strategies
4. Support scope-based memory management

## 3. Implementation Verification

### 3.1 Conformance Testing

A COIL v1 implementation should be tested against:

1. **Format Verification**
   - Correct parsing of all valid COIL objects
   - Proper rejection of invalid formats
   - Accurate encoding of instructions

2. **Instruction Verification**
   - Correct behavior for all universal instructions
   - Proper handling of all operand types
   - Accurate implementation of conditional execution

3. **Type System Verification**
   - Correct type compatibility checks
   - Proper type conversions
   - Accurate handling of all type extensions

4. **Architecture-Specific Verification**
   - Correct implementation of architecture-specific features
   - Proper register mapping
   - Accurate ABI handling

### 3.2 Reference Implementation

A reference implementation should be used to:
1. Establish baseline behavior
2. Resolve ambiguities in the specification
3. Provide examples for other implementers

### 3.3 Test Suite

A comprehensive test suite should include:
1. Unit tests for individual instructions
2. Integration tests for instruction sequences
3. Conformance tests for specification compliance
4. Architecture-specific tests
5. Performance benchmarks

## 4. Implementation Best Practices

### 4.1 Error Handling

COIL implementations should:
1. Provide clear, detailed error messages
2. Include source location information when available
3. Distinguish between warnings and errors
4. Have graceful recovery mechanisms

### 4.2 Optimization

COIL processors should implement these optimizations:
1. Register allocation strategies
2. Constant folding and propagation
3. Dead code elimination
4. Instruction combining
5. Architecture-specific optimizations

### 4.3 Debug Support

Implementations should support debugging by:
1. Preserving source mapping information
2. Implementing the debug format specification
3. Providing symbol information
4. Supporting breakpoints and stepping

### 4.4 Extension Mechanisms

While maintaining specification compliance, implementations may:
1. Provide well-documented extension mechanisms
2. Implement processor-specific instructions (0xFF)
3. Support additional type extensions
4. Add debugging and performance tools

## 5. Security Considerations

COIL implementations should address:
1. Memory safety in instruction execution
2. Protection against malformed COIL objects
3. Secure handling of extensions
4. Protection against timing attacks where relevant
