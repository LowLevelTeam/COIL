# Orion++ Binary Format

The orion++ format is setup to be compact, fast and efficient in parsing, building and distribution.

Built similar to a basic object format with simple sectioning. Type tables are defined with type definitions, ABI Tables are defined with standard calling conventions and the final code section is for the functions and code for compilation.
