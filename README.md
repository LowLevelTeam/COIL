# Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL)

The COIL Instruction Set Architecture defines a flexible binary instruction format designed for maximum portability while retaining native performance across all processing units and architectures. COIL follows a type-determined instruction philosophy where behavior is inferred from operand types, enabling compact representation while maintaining expressive power.

## The team behind COIL
The Low Level Team is a group of anonymous developers who contribute to creating a new framework under a single specification. The main contributors and core members of COIL exists entirely of LLT Members.

We at the Low Level Team pride ourselves on making clean and easy to use software for developers by developers. Focusing on creating a new language framework from replacing assembly and linkers to switching out C and python. We don't like the status quo so we made our own.

All LLT projects are built in some way on top of COIL. Utilizing the COIL framework as the backend for the development language of choice. We welcome a future built by our own hands, build around these specifications to put your own hands in play.

Your work is appreciated by The Low Level Team.
