# Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL)

## Overview

COIL is a universal binary instruction format designed for maximum portability while retaining native performance across diverse processing architectures. It bridges the gap between high-level programming languages and hardware-specific machine code.

## Key Features

- **Type-Determined Instructions**: Instructions derive behavior from operand types
- **Architecture Independence**: Clean separation between universal and platform-specific code
- **Variable System**: Abstract management of registers and memory
- **ABI System**: Automated function call conventions
- **Performance-First**: No abstraction penalties for core operations

## Version Information

Current specification version: 1.0.0

The COIL specification follows semantic versioning:
- **Major**: Incompatible changes to the instruction set or binary format
- **Minor**: Backwards-compatible additions
- **Patch**: Clarifications and documentation improvements
