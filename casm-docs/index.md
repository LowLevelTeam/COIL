# COIL Assembly Language (CASM)

## Overview

CASM (COIL Assembly) is a human-readable text representation of COIL code. It provides a syntax for writing COIL programs directly, serving as both a low-level programming language and an assembly language for COIL.

If you are building a compiler you can safely ignore this as you will be writing COIL binaries directly of course.

## Purpose

CASM addresses several important needs:

1. **Human-Writable COIL**: Allows direct programming in COIL through a readable syntax
2. **Learning Tool**: Provides a way to understand COIL concepts hands-on
3. **Implementation Reference**: Serves as a reference for COIL processor implementations
4. **Debugging Aid**: Facilitates inspection and debugging of COIL programs
