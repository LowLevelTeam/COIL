# COIL v3 Specification: Multi-Device Support
WARNING: This is not an actualy COIL specification but an idea for future development. COIL v3 will feature additions to the standard library and instruction set but how it looks it not decided.

## 1. Introduction

COIL version 3 extends the architecture to support multi-device computing environments. Building on the v1 ISA and v2 standard library, COIL v3 enables programs to utilize multiple heterogeneous processing units concurrently, with coordinated execution and memory management.

## 2. Relationship to Previous Versions

COIL v3 maintains compatibility with earlier versions:
- All v1 ISA features remain valid
- All v2 standard library functions remain available
- Single-device programs continue to work without modification

The v3 additions utilize the reserved instruction range (0x30-0x4F) from v1 and extend the configuration format and standard library.

## 4. Extended Configuration Format

The configuration format is extended to support multi-device environments:

```
[devices]
count = [number of devices]

[device.0]
type = [device type]
arch = [architecture]
features = [feature list]
memory = [memory size]

[device.1]
type = [device type]
arch = [architecture]
features = [feature list]
memory = [memory size]

[interconnect]
topology = [interconnect topology]
bandwidth = [bandwidth specifications]
latency = [latency specifications]
```

### 4.1 Device Types

Supported device types include:
- CPU - Central Processing Unit
- GPU - Graphics Processing Unit
- TPU - Tensor Processing Unit
- DSP - Digital Signal Processor
- FPGA - Field-Programmable Gate Array
- NPU - Neural Processing Unit
- QPU - Quantum Processing Unit
- Custom - Vendor-specific accelerators

### 4.2 Interconnect Topology

Describes the connectivity between devices:
- Bus - Shared communication path
- Switch - Point-to-point network
- Ring - Circular connection
- Mesh - Grid-like connection
- Custom - Vendor-specific topology

## 5. JIT Compilation Support

### 5.1 Runtime Code Translation

COIL v3 includes support for Just-In-Time compilation:

```
[jit]
enabled = [true/false]
cache = [cache directory]
optimization = [optimization level]
```

### 5.2 JIT Compilation Process

1. Source COIL is analyzed for device-specific sections
2. Target device capabilities are queried at runtime
3. Device-specific code is generated
4. Compiled code is cached for future use
5. Runtime selects between precompiled or JIT-compiled code

### 5.3 Binary Sections

The .coilo format is extended to include:
```
[jit_sections]
count = [number of JIT sections]

[jit_section.0]
device_type = [device type]
source_offset = [offset to COIL source]
source_size = [size of COIL source]
```

## 6. Extended Standard Library

```
std.device.[function]
```

- `std.device.enumerate()` - List available devices
- `std.device.select(id)` - Select a device
- `std.device.properties(id)` - Get device properties
- `std.device.memory.allocate(size)` - Allocate device memory
- `std.device.memory.free(ptr)` - Free device memory
- `std.device.memory.copy(dest, src, size)` - Copy memory

```

Each device type has specialized functions for its capabilities.

## 7. Device Switching and State Management

### 7.1 Device Context

Each device maintains its own execution context:
- Register state
- Memory state
- Execution state

### 7.2 Context Switching

When switching between devices:
1. Current device context is saved
2. Target device context is loaded
3. Execution transfers to the target device
4. Results are synchronized as specified

### 7.3 State Preservation

COIL v3 provides mechanisms to:
- Save device state to host memory
- Restore device state from host memory
- Transfer state directly between compatible devices

## 8. Implementation Requirements

To be COIL v3 compliant, a processor must:

1. Support all COIL v1 and v2 features
2. Implement the multi-device instruction set
3. Support the extended configuration format
4. Provide the extended standard library
5. Implement JIT compilation if specified devices require it

## 9. Optimization Techniques

### 9.1 Automatic Work Distribution

Processors may implement automatic workload distribution:
- Task partitioning based on device capabilities
- Memory transfer minimization
- Overlapping computation and communication
- Load balancing between devices

### 9.2 Memory Management Optimizations

- Automatic memory migration
- Prefetching across devices
- Coherent shared memory regions
- Copy-on-write semantics

## 10. Security Considerations

### 10.1 Isolation

Devices must maintain proper isolation:
- Memory isolation between contexts
- Resource usage limitations
- Controlled access to shared memory

### 10.2 Secure JIT

JIT compilation must maintain security:
- Code verification before execution
- Sandboxed compilation
- Restricted capability access

## 11. Compatibility Assurance

### 11.1 Fallback Mechanisms

For partially compatible environments:
1. Devices may emulate unsupported features
2. Operations may transparently migrate to capable devices
3. JIT compilation may generate compatibility code

### 11.2 Testing Requirements

Comprehensive testing includes:
- Multi-device interaction tests
- Performance validation under various topologies
- Error recovery scenarios
- Resource contention handling
