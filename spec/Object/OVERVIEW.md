# TBD Object

> **Note**: This project is in early development. The name "TBD" is a placeholder while we decide on the final branding.

## Overview

The TBD Object is a fast, efficient and modern object format built to replace this object format fragmentation requiring different object formats for different operating systems. TBD Objects can work with TBD Linkers to be transpiled to the native operating system object for the last step and until then you can get the ease of working with a single object format. TBD Objects try to expose features of the underlying objects yet some may or may not be supported in all formats, the TBD Linker will tell you this but so will the documentation outline the implementation guidelines for the most compatible object setups and what features are specific only to certain object formats.
