# CBCC.1

Specification for sub section one of COIL Byte Code for CPU

## Overview
Support for Integers and Basic Instructions

## Instructions
A list of instructions supported under CBCC.1 with information for encoding and decoding each.



## Architectures
A list of CPU architectures this is designed for and notes for implementations.

Just because the CPU architecture you want to target is not specifically listed here does not mean it is unsupported as most CPU architectures are built with the same general guidelines. 

We use a wide enough selection of architectures to ensure the targeted architecture you have selected will be easy to implement.
