# CBCG.1

Specification for sub section one of COIL Byte Code for GPU (CBCG)

## Overview
...

## Instructions
A list of instructions supported under CBCG.1 with information for encoding and decoding each.


## Architectures
A list of GPU architectures this is designed for and notes for implementations.

Just because the GPU architecture you want to target is not specifically listed here does not mean it is unsupported as most GPU architectures are built with the same general guidelines. 

We use a wide enough selection of architectures to ensure the targeted architecture you have selected will be easy to implement.

**Warning: GPU Architectures are referring to the binary instruction architecture and not the intermediate PTX or high level graphic drivers**
**Warning: We write raw GPU code to get the best optimizations and best integration**
